Nevamind delivers memU, which is an agentic memory framework for LLM and AI agent backends. It receives multimodal inputs (conversations, documents, images), extracts them into structured memory, and organizes them into a hierarchical file system that supports both embedding-based (RAG) and non-embedding (LLM) retrieval.
